- **Crimson**: `crimson` - For quality scores and speed data
- **Coral**: `coral` - For GPS accuracy data
- **Maroon**: `maroon` - For total acceleration magnitude

## Files Modified
- `/workspace/src/dashboard.py` - All color scheme changes implemented

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite to verify all color changes
- Verified dashboard functionality through browser testing
- Confirmed all original system tests still pass
- All plots now use red-based color scheme while maintaining visual distinction
